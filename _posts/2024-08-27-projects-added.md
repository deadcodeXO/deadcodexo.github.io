I'm excited to share two new projects I've been working on that explore different aspects of network programming: a Discord bot built with Node.js and a port scanner created in Python.

## Node.js Discord Bot

This Discord bot is designed to enhance server functionality with custom commands. Key features include:

- Flexible command handling system
- Integration with Discord's API via discord.js
- Customizable command prefix
- Robust error handling and logging

It's an excellent starting point for those interested in creating their own Discord bots or adding unique features to their servers.

## Python Port Scanner

The port scanner is a powerful tool for network analysis, offering:

- Support for scanning multiple IP addresses
- Custom port range specification
- Concurrent scanning for efficiency
- Banner grabbing from open ports
- File output for scan results
- User-friendly command-line interface

This tool is particularly useful for network administrators and security professionals needing to quickly assess open ports on systems or networks.

Both projects demonstrate the versatility of Node.js and Python in creating practical networking tools. They showcase important concepts like API interaction, multithreading, and socket programming.

Whether you're interested in chat bot development or need tools for network analysis, these projects provide a solid foundation to build upon and learn from.

Stay tuned for more updates and deep dives into these projects!
