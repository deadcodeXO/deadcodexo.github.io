# Introducing the Discord Article Bot

I'm excited to announce the development of a new Discord bot designed to manage and organize articles within your server. This versatile bot allows users to create, edit, view, and search for articles, making it an invaluable tool for communities that share and discuss written content.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-page Articles**: Create articles with multiple pages, each capable of containing text and an image.

2. **Image Support**: Each page can include an image, displayed as a thumbnail in the top-right corner of the embed.

3. **Tagging System**: Add tags to articles for easy categorization and searching.

4. **Interactive Navigation**: Use reaction emojis to navigate through multi-page articles.

5. **Search Functionality**: Search for articles by title, content, or tags.

6. **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete articles with simple commands.

## Commands

- `!articles create`: Start the interactive process of creating a new article.
- `!articles view <article_id>`: Display an article with its pages and images.
- `!articles edit <article_id>`: Edit an existing article.
- `!articles delete <article_id>`: Remove an article from the database.
- `!articles list`: Show all available articles.
- `!articles search <query>`: Find articles based on a search query.
- `!articles tag <article_id> <tags>`: Add or update tags for an article.

## Technical Details

- Built using Python and the discord.py library.
- Utilizes TinyDB as a lightweight, file-based database for storing articles.
- Implements asynchronous programming for efficient handling of Discord events.

## Beta Testing

I'm currently in the beta testing phase and as soon as the bot is ready I will add it to projects.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to refine and expand the capabilities of this exciting new tool for Discord communities!
